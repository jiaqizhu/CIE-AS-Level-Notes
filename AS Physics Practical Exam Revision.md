# AS Physics Practical Exam Revision
## Q1
## Measurement
* Follow **ALL** guidance of the question exactly
* Do not alter the experiment method
* Think roughly the trends of data before proceeding
* *Use Pencil!!*
* Look at the diagram before conducting the experiment as it may contain vital information about the procedure
## Table
* Use pencil to rough out beforehand
* Make a Big Falcon Diagram that **clearly indicated the trends of data**
* **AT LEAST SIX SETS OF DATA**
### Headers
* Quantity + Unit must be correct
* Pay attention to ~reciprocal units~
### Quality of Data
* Use **as large** a range in the given limit
* Must reflect the accuracy/precision of the equipment
* Giving the decimal places *same* as the smallest decimal places in the instrument
* **CONSTANT DECIMAL PLACES** throughout the table
### Decimal Place and Significant Figures
* **CONSTANT SIGNIFICANT FIGURES**
* Consistency of data must be shown in the original table
CALCULATIONS MUST BE CORRECT

### Graphing
* Sensible Scale (No awkward scaling e.g. 3/10)
* If a false origin is used, label the origin with F.O.
* **AT LEAST HALF OF THE GRAPH MUST BE USED***
* Scales should be labeled with the quantity measured
#### Plotting
* Plot all datapoints
* Diameter of plotted point must ~be smaller than half a square~ (use a sharp pencil to do it)
* Accurate to half a small square
* Must be possible to draw a straight LOBF within ±1.0 cm of all plotted points
##### LOBF Line of Best Fit
* Could be curve or straight, read the questions duh
* **Even distribution of points on both sides of the line**
* Only one anomalous point allowed, which must be clearly indicated (circled)
* Line must not be kinked or thicker than half a square

**Intercept, Gradient & Calculation**
* If no F.O., can directly read off the graph, beware significant figures
* If F.O., show all working
* k = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1), no dy/dx
* Two points spreading at large as possible
* Follow given formula even if it doesn’t make sense

## Q2
* **REPEATED MEASUREMENT FROM THE BEGINNING**
* Ensure that you show all readings and calculations (mean). 
* *Special Notice about time periods: measure multiple periods as one measurement*
### Uncertainty Evaluation
* Related to the accuracy of the equipment
* 一般来说是测量仪器最小分度值的 2 到 5 倍
* 或者range of multiple measurements in previous questions
### Results Evaluation
* Calculate Percentage Difference
* If the percentage difference is below 20%, the given relationship stands. If the percentage difference is more than 20%, the given relationship doesn’t stand. 

## Procedural Uncertainties & Rectifying Methods
### Universal
* Two / Six or whatever sets of data is not enough to draw a valid conclusion. 
Do more experiments, take more readings and plot a graph.

### Electric & Magnetic
* Filament lamp creates plenty of heat, which changes it resistance and adds uncertainty to measurement.
Quickly switch off power after every measurement to minimize heat’s effect on readings.

* Hard to read the exact value of ammeter / voltmeter as its fluctuating constantly.
Take multiple readings and calculate average of said readings.

* The contact points may be unclean and adds to the resistance of the circuit. 
Clean the contact point prior to experiment. 

* Voltmeter scale not sensitive and precise enough
Use digital voltmeter that reads to 0.01V.

* It is difficult to exactly replicate conditions between experiments
Use a potential divider or sliding resistor to exactly manipulate the voltage / current across a certain resistor

* Wire may be kinked or not straight
Tape the wire to a ruler / hang weights off both ends to tighten the wire / clamping down the wire

* Background magnetic interference
Conduct the experiments in a more isolated environment 

* Weak magnets
Switch to stronger magnet or more sensitive newton meter


### Equilibrium / Balance
* Difficult of balancing (with reasons)
Appropriate rectifying measures

* Movement of the (something) is affected by wind movement
Turn off the A/C unit and use a wind shield. 

* Because the ruler is balancing on a pivot, the pivot may have a small flat edge to prevent proper balancing
Use sharp edge of the pivot to properly balance 

* Friction
Lubricating the equipment to reduce friction

* (In general) some sort of obstruction to achieving total equilibrium

### Force & Motion
* Difficulty of determining the starting and stopping points (of something) because it moves too fast
Use ~video camera with slow motion~ and have ~timer / scale in view~ , then play ~frame by frame~.

* Hard to release an object without applying a force
Use electromagnet / mechanical clamp to release

* Too short a time compared to human reaction time
Increase the time to be measured by (increasing distance, etc)

* Terminal velocity not reached
Video playback with marker in view

* Hard to determine when (something) had crossed (some boundary)
Slow motion camera


#### Bounce
* Hard to judge rebounds height
Slo-mo camera and frame by frame or motion sensor + data logger + computer

* Inconsistent bounce
Use flat surfaces and turn off fan

#### Oscillation 
* Oscillation dampened too quickly
Increase amplitude

* Oscillation’s both terminals are not easily determined
Slow motion video 

### Measurement
* Parallax Error in measurements of *bottles, hanging rulers*
Get eye level perpendicular to ruler or bottle

* Rule may not be vertical
(Instructions of use of set square)

* (Something) is very small, so percentage uncertainty is high
Enlarge the measure subject or use more precise equipment
